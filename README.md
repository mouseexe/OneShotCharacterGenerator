# OneShotCharacterGenerator

Ever play in a D&D one shot and not have a character idea ready to go? 

Don't feel like wasting your precious brain cells on random yet viable builds?

Check out the One Shot Character Generator!

Now available at [charactergen.win](http://charactergen.win) or [mouseexe.pythonanywhere.com](https://mouseexe.pythonanywhere.com), you can get a character at the click of a button.

Expect new updates whenever there's a new episode of Critical Role and I feel like working on code while watching.
